### Abstract

Recently, while many assistive technology systems for the disabled have emerged with the advancement of the Information Technology (IT), there are not many solutions for people with hearing impairment.
This study aims to design and develop an assistive technology system to help the deaf adopting the process of human-centered design.
First of all, we conducted an interview with people with hearing impairment to find their needs in daily situations, and one of the core problems was related to their walking in the street with cars approaching behind them.
To resolve this problem, we developed a prototype of the car sensing system called LaneMate using Arduino platform.
We tested the prototype with four subjects, and the responses were mostly positive.
Overall, this research suggests the possibility of developing an affordable assistive technology system that helps the daily activities of people with hearing impairment.
