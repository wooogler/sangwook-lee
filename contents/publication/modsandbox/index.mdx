## Abstract

Despite the common use of automated bots for online content moderation, human moderators still spend a lot of time monitoring and updating them to ensure they are working as intended. 
We used Reddit as a case study and asked 102 moderators about their experience using AutoModerator, Reddit's built-in automated bot. 
We learned that moderators feel frustrated by the lack of testing or debugging tools for AutoModerator. 
Furthermore, we conducted interviews with six moderators---including the creator of AutoModerator---to understand their moderation processes. 
Guided by the findings, we built ModSandbox, a novel sandbox system to support the rapid verification of automated rules through false positive/negative prediction and debugging support. 
We explore the effectiveness of ModSandbox through a user study with ten active moderators. 
Results show that ModSandbox can help them rapidly test automated rules without changing or affecting their actual community and reduce the total verification time from weeks to hours.
