I am a Master's student at [KAIST School of Computing](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/),
and am being advised by [Prof. Insik Shin](http://cps.kaist.ac.kr/~ishin/)
as a member of the [CPS Lab](http://cps.kaist.ac.kr/).

I'm interested in online community moderation, interaction on AR/VR environment, and multi-device UX.
